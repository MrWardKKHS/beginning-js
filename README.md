# Welcome to the Beginning JavaScript Course ðŸš€

Are you ready to embark on a journey into the world of JavaScript programming? If so, you've come to the right place!

This repository serves as a companion to the videos on [Coding With Mr Ward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=examplevideo), where you can follow along and learn JavaScript step by step.

# Course Overview ðŸ“š

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript programming language. You will dive into concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and more. Through practical examples and exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in writing JavaScript code and solving real-world problems.

# Setting Up JavaScript Development Environment ðŸ’»

To get started with JavaScript development, you'll need to set up a few tools. Follow the steps below to install Node.js, Visual Studio Code, and Git:

## 1. Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a rich set of libraries and tools for building JavaScript applications.

To install Node.js visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org), download the installer, and run it. Follow the installation wizard to complete the setup.

After installing Node.js, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal and running the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

If the command displays the version number of Node.js, you have successfully installed it.

# About this repo

This repository contains all the tasks and exercises that you need to complete alongside the course. Each file will have instructions at the top explaining the task.

## Testing

While it is not mandatory, tests can be beneficial in verifying that your code functions as expected. You can find tests in the testing folder, and you will need to install a testing framework like Jest to run them. To install Jest, use the following command: `npm install jest`

Once you believe you have completed a task, run the test for the file. For example, `npx jest tests/exercise-1/e1p1.js` in the command line.

To run all the tests in a folder, use the command `npx jest tests/exercise-1`.

Completing the exercises and running the tests will help solidify your understanding of JavaScript concepts and sharpen your programming skills.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and have fun while learning JavaScript. Happy coding! ðŸš€
